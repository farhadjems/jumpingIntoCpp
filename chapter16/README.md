Chapter 16 Practice problems
1. Write a recursive algorithm to compute the power function pow(x, y) = x^y

2. Write a recursive function that takes an array and displays the elements in reverse order without starting the index of the array at the end. (In other words, don’t write the equivalent of a loop that starts printing at the end of the array.)

3. Write a recursive algorithm to remove elements from a linked list. Write a recursive algorithm to add elements into a linked list. Try writing the same algorithms using iteration. Do the recursive implementations or the iterative implementations feel more natural?

4. Write a recursive function that takes a sorted array and a target element and finds that element in the array (returning the index, or -1 if the element isn’t in the array). How fast can you make this search? Can you do better than looking having to look at every element?

5. Write a recursive algorithm to solve the towers of Hanoi problem. Here’s a website that describes the problem and lets you try it out for yourself: http://www.mazeworks.com/hanoi/index.htm
