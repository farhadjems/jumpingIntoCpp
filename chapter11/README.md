Chapter 11 Practice problems

1. Write a program that lets the user fill in a single structure with the name, address, and phone number of a single person

2. Create an array of space ship objects and write a program that continually updates their positions until they all go off the screen. Assume that the size of the screen is 1024 pixels by 768 pixels.

3. Create an address book program that builds on problem #1—this time, the user should be able to not just fill out a single structure, but should be able to add new entries, each with a separate name and phone number. Let the user add as many entries as he or she wants—is this easy to do? It is even possible? Add the ability to display all, or some of the entries, letting the user browse the list of entries.

4. Write a program that allows a user to enter high scores of a game, keeping tracking of the name of the user and the score. Add the ability to show the highest score for each user, all scores for a particular user, all scores from all users, and the list of users.
