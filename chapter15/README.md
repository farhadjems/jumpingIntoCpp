Chapter 15 Practice problems

1. Write a program to remove an element from a linked list; the remove function should take just the element to be removed. Is this function easy to writeâ€”and will it be fast? Could this be made easier or faster by adding an additional pointer to the list? 35

2. Write a program that adds elements to a linked list in sorted order, rather than at the beginning.

3. Write a program to find an element in a linked list by name.

4. Implement a two player tic-tac-toe game. First use a linked list to represent the board. Then use an array. Which is easier? Why?
