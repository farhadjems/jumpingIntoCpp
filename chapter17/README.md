Chapter 17 Practice problems

1. Write a program to display the contents of a binary tree. Can you write a program that prints the nodes in a binary tree in sorted order? What about in reverse sorted order?

2. Write a program that counts the number of nodes in a binary tree.

3. Write a program that checks whether a binary tree is properly balanced.

4. Write a program that checks if the binary tree is properly sorted so that all nodes to the left of a given node are less than the value of that node, and all nodes to the right are greater than the value of that node.

5. Write a program that deletes all of the nodes in a binary tree without using recursion.

6. Implement a simple map, in the form of a binary tree, that holds an address book; the key for the map should be a person's name and the value should be the person's email address. You should provide the ability to add email addresses to the map, remove email addresses, update email addresses, and of course find email addresses. You'll also want to clean up your address book when your program shuts down. As a reminder, you can use any of the standard C++ comparison operators (such as == , < or > ) to compare two strings.
