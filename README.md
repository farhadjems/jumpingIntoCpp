#Jumping Into C++ - Alex Allain

This is the first text book I read to learn C++. the book is great and the writer tried to teach concepts in the easiest and funny way.
In this repo, I present my solutions to the practice problems introduced in each chapter. 
I tried my best to solve the problems with the concepts and tools related to the curresponding chapter, but some of them are so hard. So, I decided to use some tools which might be not studied untill that chapter.
