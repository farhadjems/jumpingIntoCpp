Chapter 09 Practice problems

1. Write a program that simulates a coin flip. Run it many times—do the results look random to you?

2. Write a program that picks a number between 1 and 100, and then lets the user guess what the number is. The program should tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or just right.

3. Write a program that solves the guessing game from part 1. How many guesses does your program need?

4. Make a "slot machine" game that randomly displays the results of a slot machine to a player—have 3 (or more) possible values for each wheel of the slot machine. Don't worry about displaying the text "spinning" by. Just choose the results and display them and print out the winnings (choose your own winning combinations).

5. Write a program to play poker! You can provide 5 cards to the player, let that player choose new cards, and then determine how good the hand is. Think about whether this is easy to do? What problems might you have in terms of keeping track of cards that have been drawn already? Was this easier or harder than the slot machine?
