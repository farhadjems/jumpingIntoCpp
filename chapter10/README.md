Chapter 10 Practice problems

1. Turn the code that we wrote for insertionSort into an insertionSort function that works for any sized
array.

2. Write a program that takes in 50 values and prints out the highest, the lowest, the average and
then all 50 input values, one per line.

3. Write a program that detects if a list is sorted or not, and if it is not sorted, sort it.

4. Write a small tic-tac-toe program that allows two players to play tic-tac-toe competitively. Your
program should check to see if either player has won, or if the board is filled completely (with
the game ending in a tie). Bonus: can you make your program detect if the game cannot be won
by either side before the entire grid is filled?

5. Make your tic-tac-toe game into a version of connect-4 that allow boards bigger than 3 by 3 but
requires 4-in-a-row to win. Allow the players to specify the size of the board while the program
is running. (Hint: right now, you have to define your board to be a fixed size at compile time, so
you may need to limit the maximum size of the board.)

6. Make a two-player checkers program that allows each player to make a move, and checks for
legal moves and whether the game is over. Be sure to support kinging! Feel free to add support
for any house rules that you use when you play. Consider making the kind of rules used an
option at program startup.
