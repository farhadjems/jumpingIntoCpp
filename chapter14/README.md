Chapter 14 Practice problems

1. Write a function that builds the multiplication table of arbitrary dimensions

2. Write a function that takes 3 arguments, a length, width and height, dynamically allocates a 3-dimensional array with those values and fills the 3-dimensional array with multiplication tables. Make sure to free the array when you are done.

3. Write a program that prints out the memory addresses of each element in a 2-dimensional array. Check to see if the values printed out make sense to you based on the way I explained it before.

4. Write a program that lets users keep track of the last time they talked to each of their friends. Users should be able to add new friends (as many as they want!) and store the number of days ago that they last talked to each friend. Let users update this value (but don't let them put in bogus numbers like negative values). Make it possible to display the list sorted by the names of the friends of by how recently it was since they talked to each friend.

5. Write a two-player game of "connect 4" 31 where the user can set the width and height of the board and each player gets a turn to drop a token into the slot. Display the board using + for one side, x for the other, and _ to indicate blank spaces.

6. Write a program that takes a width and a height and dynamically generates a maze with the given width and height. The maze must always have a valid path through it (how can you ensure this?) Print the maze to the screen once itâ€™s been generated. For all practice problems, try to write one version with pointers, and one version with references. Make sure to free any memory you allocate.
