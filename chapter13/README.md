Chapter 13 Practice problems

1. Write a function that prompts the user to enter his or her first name and last name, as two separate values. This function should return both values to the caller via additional pointer (or reference) parameters that are passed to the function. Try doing this first with pointers and then with references. (Hint: the function signature will look be similar to the swap function from earlier!)

2. Draw a diagram similar to the ones I drew to demonstrate the swap function, but for the function you wrote in exercise 1.

3. Modify the program you wrote for exercise 1 so that instead of always prompting the user for a last name, it does so only if the caller passes in a NULL pointer for the last name.

4. Write a function that takes two input arguments and provides two separate results to the caller, one that is the result of multiplying the two arguments, the other the result of adding them. Since you can directly return only one value from a function, you'll need the second value to be returned through a pointer or reference parameter.

5. Write a program that compares the memory addresses of two different variables on the stack and prints out the order of the variables by numerical order of their addresses. Does the order surprise you?
